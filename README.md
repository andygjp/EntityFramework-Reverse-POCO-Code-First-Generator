### Project Description

Reverse engineers an existing database and generates Entity Framework Code
First Poco classes, Configuration mappings and DbContext.

Please note, this is not the Microsoft reverse generator.
This is one I created to generate beautiful code-first code, as if I
had hand-crafted the code-first code myself. It also allows me to customise
the generated code to my liking.

### Supported databases

* SQL Server
* SQL Server Compact 3.5 and 4.0

### Highly customisable output

This generator was designed to be customisable from the very beginning,
and not fixed and rigid like other generators.
Go and play with the settings in the `<database>.tt` file, that's what it's there for.

If your database changes, simply re-save the `<database>.tt` file. That's it.

### To install and use this project:

* For Visual Studio 2012 & 2013, install Entity Framework 6 Tools
  [available here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40762)
  This installs the required EF6.Utility.CS.ttinclude which is used for pluralisation
  You only need to do this once.
* Use Nuget and install EntityFramework.
* Add a connect string to your app.config. Something like:
```xml
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="MyDbContext"
       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"
       connectionString="Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=MyDatabase;Integrated Security=True; />
</connectionStrings>
```
* The connection string you use must have at least these privileges: `ddladmin`, `datareader` and `datawriter`.
  `ddladmin` is required for reading the default constraints.
* In Visual Studio, right click project and select "add - new item".
* Select Online, and search for **reverse poco**.
* Select **EntityFramework Reverse POCO Generator**.
* Give the file a name, such as `Database.tt` and click Add.
* Edit the `Database.tt` file and specify the connection string as "**MyDbContext**" which matches your name in `app.config`.
* Save the `Database.tt` file, which will now generate the `Database.cs` file.
* There are many options you can use to customise the generated code.
  All of these settings are in the `Database.tt` files.

### UI

A simple UI for the generator is available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/sjh37/EntityFramework-Reverse-POCO-Generator-UI) which helps you to create a regex to filter your tables.

### Editing TT (T4) Files
To have full syntax highlighting and intellisense when editing TT files, I use the Resharper plugin ForTea. I can't imagine editing TT files without it.

### Getting a pull request accepted
Have a read of [https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request](How to write the perfect pull request)

My requirements are simple:

1. Always keep the changes to a **minimum**, so I can see **exactly** what's changed in regard to the pull request. I.e. No whitespace tidy up, etc.
2. No tabs, only spaces (4).
3. Don't move functions about, please leave them where they are.
4. No new files. This will always get rejected. Add any new code/classes into the two existing .ttinclude files.
5. Don't be tempted to do a few different enhancements in one pull request. Have **one** pull request for **one** bug fix / enhancement.
